# NeuralNetworkTrainerGUI
GUI for NeuralNetworkTrainer project created with JavaFX

The project supports:
1) Creating a neural network with user-entered number of layers and with either zero or random weights and biases;
2) Saving and loading neural networks to/from files;
3) Testing (evaluating) neural networks on user-entered data;
4) Training neural networks on user-provided samples;
5) Loading training samples from *.csv files.

Currently under active development.
